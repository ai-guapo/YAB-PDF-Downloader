  <p>Yet Another Button: PDF Downloader is a simple tool that makes downloading PDF files from websites a breeze. If you’re currently viewing a PDF, the app generates a button that lets you save the file with just one click. Even better, it can snag PDFs that don’t have an obvious download option, allowing you to effortlessly collect research papers, guides, or anything else that catches your eye.</p>
